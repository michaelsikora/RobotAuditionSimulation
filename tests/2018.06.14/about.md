Two 3mic clusters were used, set a half meter apart.

One source was set at 3.5 meters from the midpoint between the clusters.
The source used was a banded white noise source filtered to be between
200 and 3800 Hertz. 

The SRP image was gathered for 4 orientations. The source was windowed 
iteratively in time with a 0.5 second increment. The orientations were
generated using the pitch and yaw angles. Angles were randomly selected
for the pitch in the range of 0 to 90 degrees. Angles were randomly 
selected for the yaw in the range of -90 to 90 degrees.

The average, minimum and maximum images were calculated, plotted and saved
as .png's. The main lobe was calculated by amplitude thresholding the image
by the max value of the image times one over the squareroot of two. The 
outline of the thresholded region was plotted in black.
